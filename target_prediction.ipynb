    "\n",
    "This project aims to <b>predict if an input pair of sequences (miRNA and mRNA) will interact</b>; given that the molecules interact, they constitute a pair, whereas if they do not interact, they are defined as non-pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the mechanisms underlying the targeting process can differ between organisms, this study is <b>focused on the A. thaliana organism</b>. This is a model organism, meaning that the results obtained can be extrapolated to other plants; furthermore, they can be used to understand human diseases due to the conservation of protein function, conservation of cellular processes, and the high percentage of genes shared between both species [31, 32].\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the above, this problem can be shaped as a <b>binary classification problem</b>, where 0 means non-pair and 1 represents a pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data proposed to train a DNN able to distinguish between pair and non-pair RNA sequences consists of curated interactions that are publicly available and reported in the literature [14].\n",
    "\n",
    "Although such miRNA-mRNA interacting pairs can be used to train the network, they represent only positive examples that were tested experimentally either in vivo or in vitra. This implies that the <b>available datasets are unbalanced</b>, and denotes the need to incorporate negative data before proceeding."

Success measures</i>, this project aims to <b>ensure the presence of negative and positive examples in the train, test, and validation datasets</b>. Therefore, the negative and positive datasets will be separately split into train, test, validation; then the respective train, test, and validation sets will be merged to include both positive and negative examples.\n",

    "One important consideration at this stage is the features to use to feed the network. The datasets were prepared to contain names of the molecules using a normalized nomenclature for either miRNA or mRNA target; however, names should not be used to predict the probability of interaction between the molecules, and only nucleotide sequences must be taken into consideration for training. Thus, the model should take as input a pair $x_1$ (miRNA sequence), $x_2$ (target sequence), and produce an output $y$ (predicted interaction)."
